# importer
By Luca Cavicchioli.

Import files from remote.

This is the script I use to import files from the machine that
generates data to my personal machine. The remote machine is specified
in my /etc/fstab file, and therefore I can mount it with just a mount
command.

I advise against verbatim usage of this script, as it is made just to
work on my machine, but feel free to otherwise take code from this
repository.

All the code in this repository is released under public domain.
